Are eRRγ target genes poor prognostic factors in Tamoxifen-treated breast cancer?,"[""One-third of estrogen (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor-positive (PGR+) breast tumors treated with Tamoxifen (TAM) do not respond to initial treatment, and the remaining 70% are at risk to relapse in the future. Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG, ERRγ) is an orphan nuclear receptor with broad, structural similarities to classical ER that is widely implicated in the transcriptional regulation of energy homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated that ERRγ induces resistance to TAM in ER+ breast cancer models, and that the receptor's transcriptional activity is modified by activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. We hypothesize that hyper-activation or over-expression of ERRγ induces a pro-survival transcriptional program that impairs the ability of TAM to inhibit the growth of ER+ breast cancer. The goal of the present study is to determine whether ERRγ target genes are associated with reduced distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in ER+ breast cancer treated with TAM.""
 'Raw gene expression data was obtained from 3 publicly available breast cancer clinical studies of women with ER+ breast cancer who received TAM as their sole endocrine therapy. ERRγ target genes were selected from 2 studies that published validated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of ERRγ promoter occupancy. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to determine the association of ERRγ target genes with DMFS, and selected genes were validated in ER+, MCF7 breast cancer cells that express exogenous ERRγ.'
 'Thirty-seven validated receptor target genes were statistically significantly altered in women who experienced a DM within 5 years, and could classify several independent studies into poor vs. good DMFS. Two genes (EEF1A2 and PPIF) could similarly separate ER+, TAM-treated breast tumors by DMFS, and their protein levels were measured in an ER+ breast cancer cell line model with exogenous ERRγ. Finally, expression of ERRγ and these two target genes are elevated in models of ER+ breast cancer with hyperactivation of ERK/MAPK.']","ERRγ signaling is associated with poor DMFS in ER+, TAM-treated breast cancer, and ESRRG, EEF1A2, and PPIF comprise a 3-gene signaling node that may contribute to TAM resistance in the context of an active ERK/MAPK pathway.",medium,"ERRγ target genes are associated with improved distant metastasis-free survival in ER+, Tamoxifen-treated breast cancer.",Misinterpretation of #Question#
Do fermentable fibers affect satiety or food intake by women who do not practice restrained eating?,"['Fiber is thought to enhance satiety, although not all fibers are equally effective. Colonic fermentation may influence satiety and food intake.'

 'Within-subject preload design with repeated measures. Each participant completed five conditions, presented in random order.'
 'Participants were 22 adult women who do not practice restrained eating (body mass index 18 to 29).'
 'The experimental conditions were four fiber treatments: 10 g oligofructose, inulin, soluble corn fiber, or resistant wheat starch in chocolate crisp bars. A no-added-fiber bar was evaluated as the control. The night before each treatment, participants consumed a dinner bar containing 10 g of the same fiber given the next morning.'
 'Repeated ratings of feelings related to hunger and fullness at the lunch meal were the main measures. Secondary outcomes included breath hydrogen and methane, gastrointestinal symptoms, energy consumed at an ad libitum lunch, and energy from 24-hour dietary recall.'
 'Mixed-effect linear models with random intercept for participants to model within-subject correlation.'
 'All treatments were well tolerated. No differences were found in subjective satiety during the morning or food intake at lunch or over 24 hours.

Is soluble VE-cadherin involved in endothelial barrier breakdown in systemic inflammation and sepsis?,"['Microvascular endothelial barrier breakdown in sepsis precedes organ failure and death in patients. We tested the hypothesis that the formation of endothelium-derived soluble vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin fragments (sVE-cadherin) is involved in inflammation-induced endothelial barrier disruption.'
 'Incubation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) with tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to endothelial barrier disruption which correlated with significantly increased sVE-cadherin at a size of ∼90 kDa in cell culture supernatants. Inhibition of the VE-cadherin-cleaving disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM10 using GI254023X attenuated inflammation-induced formation of sVE-cadherin and endothelial barrier disruption, suggesting ADAM10-mediated shedding as a mechanism underlying sVE-cadherin release. Formation of VE-cadherin fragments at 90 and 110 kDa was observed when recombinant VE-cadherin (rVE-cadherin) was digested with recombinant ADAM10. Mass spectrometry of the VE-cadherin fragments showed that they originated from cleavage of the extracelluar domain and thereby several cleavage sites of ADAM10 were identified. Atomic force microscopy measurements demonstrated that cell culture supernatants containing sVE-cadherin and application of rVE-cadherin blocked VE-cadherin binding. Accordingly rVE-cadherin dose-dependently led to loss of endothelial barrier functions in HDMEC monolayers. Finally, in patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock with clinical signs of a microvascular leackage, serum levels of sVE-cadherin were significantly increased.']","Taken together, formation of sVE-cadherin is associated and contributes to inflammation-induced breakdown of endothelial barrier functions by inhibition of VE-cadherin binding. The underlying mechanism of VE-cadherin cleavage involves ADAM10 and appears to be of clinical relevance since sVE-cadherin was augmented in patients with severe sepsis.",medium,"Soluble VE-cadherin (sVE-cadherin) significantly contributes to endothelial barrier breakdown in systemic inflammation and sepsis through direct interaction with platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR).

Does sensing of fatty acids for octanoylation of ghrelin involve a gustatory G-protein?,"[""Ghrelin is an important regulator of energy--and glucose homeostasis. The octanoylation at Ser(3) is essential for ghrelin's biological effects but the mechanisms involved in the octanoylation are unknown. We investigated whether the gustatory G-protein, α-gustducin, and the free fatty acid receptors GPR40 and GPR120 are involved in the fatty acid sensing mechanisms of the ghrelin cell.""
 'Wild-type (WT) and α-gustducin knockout (gust(-/-)) mice were fed a glyceryl trioctanoate-enriched diet (OD) during 2 weeks. Ghrelin levels and gastric emptying were determined. Co-localization between GPR40, GPR120 and ghrelin or α-gustducin/α-transducin was investigated by immunofluorescence staining. The role of GPR120 in the effect of medium and long chain fatty acids on the release of ghrelin was studied in the ghrelinoma cell line, MGN3-1. The effect of the GPR40 agonist, MEDICA16, and the GPR120 agonist, grifolic acid, on ghrelin release was studied both in vitro and in vivo.'
 'Feeding an OD specifically increased octanoyl ghrelin levels in the stomach of WT mice but not of gust(-/-) mice. Gastric emptying was accelerated in WT but not in gust(-/-) mice. GPR40 was colocalized with desoctanoyl but not with octanoyl ghrelin, α-gustducin or α-transducin positive cells in the stomach. GPR120 only colocalized with ghrelin in the duodenum. Addition of octanoic acid or α-linolenic acid to MGN3-1 cells increased and decreased octanoyl ghrelin levels, respectively. Both effects could not be blocked by GPR120 siRNA. MEDICA16 and grifolic acid did not affect ghrelin secretion in vitro but oral administration of grifolic acid increased plasma ghrelin levels.']",This study provides the first evidence that α-gustducin is involved in the octanoylation of ghrelin and shows that the ghrelin cell can sense long- and medium-chain fatty acids directly. GPR120 but not GPR40 may play a role in the lipid sensing cascade of the ghrelin cell.,easy,"Sensing of fatty acids for octanoylation of ghrelin involves a gustatory G-protein, α-transducin, rather than α-gustducin.

Does prolonged head down bed rest-induced inactivity impair tonic autonomic regulation while sparing oscillatory cardiovascular rhythms in healthy humans?,"['Physical inactivity represents a major risk for cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, myocardial infarction or sudden death; however, underlying mechanisms are not clearly elucidated. Clinical and epidemiological investigations suggest, beyond molecular changes, the possibility of an induced impairment in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. However, this hypothesis has not been tested directly.'
 'Accordingly, we planned a study with noninvasive, minimally intrusive, techniques on healthy volunteers. Participants were maintained for 90 days strictly in bed, 24 h a day, in head-down (-6 degrees ) position (HDBR). Physical activity was thus virtually abolished for the entire period of HDBR. We examined efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity, as a measure of vascular sympathetic control, baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, heart rate variability (assessing cardiovagal regulation), RR and systolic arterial pressure and low-frequency and high-frequency normalized components (as a window on central oscillatory regulation). Measures were obtained at rest and during simple maneuvers (moderate handgrip, lower body negative pressure and active standing) to assess potential changes in autonomic cardiovascular responsiveness to standard stimuli and the related oscillatory profiles.'
 'HDBR transiently reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity, RR, heart rate variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity late during HDBR or early during the recovery phase. Conversely, oscillatory profiles of RR and systolic arterial pressure variability were maintained throughout. Responsiveness to test stimuli was also largely maintained.']","Prolonged inactivity as induced by HDBR in healthy volunteers reduces both cardiovagal and vascular sympathetic regulation, while largely maintaining peripheral responsiveness to standardized stimuli and sparing the functional structure of central oscillatory cardiovascular regulation.",medium,"Prolonged inactivity induced by head-down bed rest significantly impairs tonic autonomic regulation, as evidenced by reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diminished baroreceptor reflex sensitivity.

Does inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 3 dilate the rat ductus arteriosus without inducing intimal thickening?,"['\u2002Prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)), via cAMP, dilates the ductus arteriosus (DA). For patients with DA-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD), PGE(1) is the sole DA dilator that is used until surgery, but PGE(1) has a short duration of action, and frequently induces apnea. Most importantly, PGE(1) increases hyaluronan (HA) production, leading to intimal thickening (IT) and eventually DA stenosis after long-term use. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate potential DA dilators, such as phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitors, as alternatives to PGE(1).'
 '\u2002Expression of PDE3a and PDE3b mRNAs in rat DA tissue was higher than in the pulmonary artery. I.p. milrinone (10 or 1mg/kg) or olprinone (5 or 0.5mg/kg) induced maximal dilatation of the DA lasting for up to 2h in rat neonates. In contrast, vasodilation induced by PGE(1) (10μg/kg) was diminished within 2h. No respiratory distress was observed with milrinone or olprinone. Most important, milrinone did not induce HA production, cell migration, or proliferation when applied to cultured rat DA smooth muscle cells. Further, high expression of both PDE3a and PDE3b was demonstrated in the human DA tissue of CHD patients.']"," Because PDE3 inhibitors induced longer-lasting vasodilation without causing apnea or HA-mediated IT, they may be good alternatives to PGE(1) for patients with DA-dependent CHD. ",medium,Inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 3 significantly constricts the rat ductus arteriosus without inducing intimal thickening.,Misinterpretation of #Question#

Does lymph node yield at radical cystectomy predict mortality in node-negative and not node-positive patients?,"['To better define the relationship between lymph node count and survival in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer by identifying and controlling for key confounding variables in a large population-based cohort. Considerable controversy remains regarding the correlation between node count and survival, and most prior analyses have not accounted for both patient and provider factors.'
 'The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database was used to identify patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma who underwent radical cystectomy from 1992 to 2006. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on the presence or absence of nodal metastases, and we performed Cox regression analyses to evaluate the association between node count and survival. Covariates included age, Charlson comorbidity index, stage, grade, lymph node density, number of positive nodes, urinary diversion, chemotherapy, year of surgery, transfusion, and surgeon volume.'
 'The cohort consisted of 2391 node-negative and 779 node-positive patients. In node-negative patients, individuals with low node counts had significantly worse overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) compared to the highest node count tertile. In node-positive patients, node count was not an independent predictor of OS or DSS.']","Lymph node count at radical cystectomy is associated with both OS and DSS in patients without nodal metastases. However, in patients with node-positive disease, node count is not an independent predictor of survival suggesting that it is likely a proxy for other patient and provider factors in these individuals.",hard,"Lymph node count at radical cystectomy is correlated with overall survival and disease-specific survival in node-negative patients, but this correlation weakens in node-positive patients where it becomes a less reliable predictor of survival outcomes.

Does mechanical stress eliminate the effects of plasma from patients with preeclampsia on endothelial cells?,"['Our purpose was to determine whether mechanical deformation alters in vitro effects of plasma from patients with preeclampsia on endothelial cell function to produce a paradigm similar to the in vivo disease state.'
 'The effects of 2% plasma from 12 patients with preeclampsia and 12 normal pregnant women on prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and endothelin production by cultured endothelial cells were measured in the presence or absence of cyclic stretch and laminar shear stress.'
 'In the absence of mechanical stress plasma from patients with preeclampsia resulted in greater prostacyclin and nitric oxide production (but no change in endothelin production) compared with plasma from normal pregnant women. Cyclic stretch did not affect prostacyclin or endothelin production but produced similar increases in nitric oxide production in cells exposed to plasma from the two groups. Shear stress markedly increased prostacyclin and nitric oxide production (but did not alter endothelin production). In the presence of shear stress there were no differences in production rates of nitric oxide or prostacyclin between cells exposed to plasma from the two groups.']",Shear stress alters the effects of plasma on endothelial cells.

Does paracrine sonic hedgehog signalling by prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation?,"['Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and components of its signalling pathway have been identified in human prostate carcinoma and increased levels of their expression appear to correlate with disease progression and metastasis. The mechanism through which Shh signalling could promote metastasis in bone, the most common site for prostate carcinoma metastasis, has not yet been investigated. The present study determined the effect of Shh signalling between prostate cancer cells and pre-osteoblasts on osteoblast differentiation, a requisite process for new bone formation that characterizes prostate carcinoma metastasis.'
 'LNCaP human prostate cancer cells modified to overexpress Shh (designated LNShh cells) and MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts were maintained as mixed populations within the same culture chamber. In this non-conventional mixed culture system, LNShh cells upregulated the expression of Shh target genes Gli1 and Patched 1 (Ptc1) in MC3T3 cells and this was inhibited by cyclopamine, a specific chemical inhibitor of hedgehog signalling. Concomitantly, MC3T3 cells exhibited time-dependent decreased cell proliferation, upregulated alkaline phosphatase Akp2 gene expression, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity indicative of early phase osteoblast differentiation. LNShh cell-induced differentiation was inhibited in MC3T3 cells stably transfected with a dominant negative form of Gli1, a transcription factor that mediates Shh signalling. Interestingly, LNShh cells did not significantly increase the endogenous expression of the osteoblast differentiation transcription factor Runx2 and its target genes osteocalcin and osteopontin. Consistent with these results, exogenous Shh peptide did not upregulate Runx2 expression in MC3T3 cells. However, Runx2 levels were increased in MC3T3 cells by ascorbic acid, a known stimulator of osteoblast differentiation.']","Altogether, these data demonstrate that Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells can directly and specifically induce differentiation in pre-osteoblasts via a Gli1-dependent mechanism that does not require transcriptional upregulation of Runx2. Paracrine activation of the Shh pathway in osteoblast progenitors and subsequent induction of osteoblast differentiation could be a mechanism through which high levels of Shh expression in prostate carcinoma contribute to bone metastasis.

Does activating PPARα prevent post-ischemic contractile dysfunction in hypertrophied neonatal hearts?,"['Post-ischemic contractile dysfunction is a contributor to morbidity and mortality after the surgical correction of congenital heart defects in neonatal patients.

Does human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 overexpression reinforce oncogene-induced senescence through CXCR2/p21 signaling in breast cancer cells?,"['hPTTG1 (human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) is an oncogene overexpressed in breast cancer and several other types of cancer. Increased hPTTG1 expression has been shown to be associated with poor patient outcomes in breast cancer. Although hPTTG1 overexpression plays important roles in promoting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, it also has been suggested to induce cellular senescence. Deciphering the mechanism by which hPTTG1 overexpression induces these contradictory actions in breast cancer cells is critical to our understanding of the role of hPTTG1 in breast cancer development.'
 'MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells were used to identify the mechanism of hPTTG1-induced senescence. The interplay between hPTTG1 overexpression and chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2 (CXCR2)/p21-dependent senescence in tumor growth and metastasis of MCF-7 cells was investigated by orthotopic transplantation of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Additionally, human invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue arrays were used to confirm the hPTTG1/CXCR2/p21 axis established in vitro.'
 'In this study, we investigated the mechanism of hPTTG1-induced senescence as well as its role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Herein, we showed that hPTTG1 overexpression reinforced senescence through the CXCR2/p21 signaling. Furthermore, hPTTG1 overexpression activated NF-κB signaling to transactivate the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and growth-regulated oncogene alpha (GROα) to execute CXCR2 signaling in MCF-7 cells. When CXCR2 expression was knocked down in hPTTG1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells, hPTTG1-induced senescence was abrogated by alleviating CXCR2-induced p21 expression. In a mouse model, CXCR2-mediated senescence limited hPTTG1-induced tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, CXCR2 knockdown in hPTTG1-overexpressing MCF-7 tumors dramatically accelerated tumor growth and metastasis. Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that hPTTG1 overexpression reinforces senescence through CXCR2 signaling, and the evasion of CXCR2/p21-dependent senescence was critical to hPTTG1 exerting its oncogenic potential. Interestingly, although CXCR2-dependent senescence restrained hPTTG1-induced tumor progression, when MCF-7 cells and hPTTG1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells were co-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of SCID mice, hPTTG1-overexpressing senescent cells created a metastasis-promoting microenvironment that promoted lung metastasis of the MCF-7 cells.

The atherosclerotic process begins during the prediabetic phase characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. In vitro studies have suggested that glucose and insulin can substantially alter the structure and function of the arterial wall and affect the development of atherosclerosis.'
 ""We performed a cross-sectional study of the relation of arterial stiffness indexes with glucose tolerance and serum insulin concentrations. Several indexes of common carotid artery stiffness were assessed with noninvasive ultrasound methods in a biracial sample of 4701 men and women 45 to 64 years of age in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Arterial compliance (AC), stiffness index (SI), pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), and Young's elastic modulus (YEM) were calculated. YEM includes wall (intima-media) thickness and thus gives an estimate of arterial stiffness controlling for wall thickness. All indexes of arterial stiffness were higher with increasing concentrations of fasting glucose. This finding was consistent in both black and white examines and in both sexes. A 25% increase in fasting glucose (approximately 1 SD) was associated in nondiabetic white men with a 5.8% (95% CI, -9.6% to -1.9%; P = .004) decrease in AC and increases of 5.8% (95% CI, 2.0% to 9.7%; P = .002) in SI, 11.3% (95% CI, 6.9% to 15.9%; P < .001) in Ep, and 11.2% (95% CI, 6.2% to 16.6%; P < .001) in YEM.

Is eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1 alpha associated with a specific subset of mRNAs in Trypanosoma cruzi?,"['Regulation of gene expression in trypanosomatids is mainly posttranscriptional. Tight regulation of mRNA stability and access to polysomes allows Trypanosoma cruzi to adapt to different environmental conditions during its life cycle. Posttranscriptional regulation requires association between mRNAs and specific proteins to form mRNP complexes. Proteins that lack a canonical RNA-binding domain, such as eukaryotic elongation factor-1α (EF-1α), may also associate with mRNPs. EF-1α is conserved in many organisms, and it plays roles in many cellular processes other than translation, including RNA transport, the cell cycle, and apoptosis.'
 'In a previous study, EF-1α was found associated with mRNP-forming mRNAs in polysome-free fractions both in epimastigotes growing under normal conditions and in nutritionally stressed parasites. This finding suggested the possibility that EF-1α has a non-canonical function. Thus, we investigated the dynamics of EF-1α in association with T. cruzi epimastigote mRNAs under normal and stressed nutritional conditions. EF-1α is expressed throughout the parasite life cycle, but it shows a slight decrease in protein levels in the metacyclic trypomastigote form. The protein is cytoplasmically localized with a granular pattern in all forms analyzed. Following puromycin treatment, EF-1α migrated with the heaviest gradient fractions in a sucrose polysome profile, indicating that its association with large protein complexes was independent of the translation machinery. We next characterized the EF-1α-associated mRNAs in unstressed and stressed epimastigotes. We observed that specific subsets of mRNAs were associated with EF-1α-mRNPs in unstressed or stressed epimastigotes.

Does tGFβ inhibition during expansion phase increase the chondrogenic re-differentiation capacity of human articular chondrocytes?,"['Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a cell-based treatment to repair articular cartilage defects, relying on the availability of expanded (de-differentiated) chondrocytes. Unfortunately, the expansion process causes several phenotypical changes, requiring re-establishment of the native chondrogenic phenotype to sustain proper repair. Among other proteins, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is known to influence the chondrogenic re-differentiation of human articular chondrocytes (HACs) and their matrix deposition. Thus we investigated the effects of TGFβ-depletion during the expansion phase.'
 'HACs were isolated from articular cartilage and expanded in the canonical serum-supplemented medium [fetal calf serum (FCS)] or in a chemically-defined (CD) medium, with or without anti-TGFβ antibody administration. The re-differentiation potential of the cells was assessed by pellet cultures, gene expression analysis and histology.'
 'Cell proliferation proceeded more rapidly in CD-medium than in FCS-medium; it was not affected by the use of anti-TGFβ antibody but was further increased by addition of exogenous TGFβ1, via increased p-Smad1/5/8. Conversely, in FCS-medium, addition of anti-TGFβ antibody decreased both proliferation and p-Smad1/5/8 level. Challenging either FCS- or CD-medium with anti-TGFβ antibody during expansion enhanced chondrogenesis in the subsequent pellet cultures. Moreover, TGFβ-depletion during expansion in CD-medium inhibited mRNA expression of hypertrophic markers, collagen type-X (COL10) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Interestingly, the TGFβ1 level detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay (ELISA) during cell expansion was correlated with COL10 mRNA expression after re-differentiation.']",TGFβ-depletion during expansion improves the re-differentiation capacity of chondrocytes and inhibits hypertrophy. These results indicate the importance of the expansion medium composition to improve chondrogenic re-differentiation and to inhibit hypertrophy.,easy,Administration of TGFβ during the expansion phase enhances the chondrogenic re-differentiation capacity of human articular chondrocytes.,Misinterpretation of #Question#

 'Surface expression of PD-1 on immune effector cells, and PD-L1 expression on CD138(+) multiple myeloma cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were determined in BM from newly diagnosed (ND) multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma versus healthy donor (HD). We defined the impact of single and dual blockade of PD-1/PD-L1, alone and with lenalidomide, on autologous anti-multiple myeloma immune response and tumor cell growth.'
 'Both ND and RR patient multiple myeloma cells have increased PD-L1 mRNA and surface expression compared with HD. There is also a significant increase in PD-1 expression on effector cells in multiple myeloma. Importantly, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade abrogates BM stromal cell (BMSC)-induced multiple myeloma growth, and combined blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 with lenalidomide further inhibits BMSC-induced tumor growth. These effects are associated with induction of intracellular expression of IFNγ and granzyme B in effector cells. Importantly, PD-L1 expression in multiple myeloma is higher on MDSC than on antigen-presenting cells, and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade inhibits MDSC-mediated multiple myeloma growth. Finally, lenalidomide with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade inhibits MDSC-mediated immune suppression.']","Our data therefore demonstrate that checkpoint signaling plays an important role in providing the tumor-promoting, immune-suppressive microenvironment in multiple myeloma, and that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade induces anti-multiple myeloma immune response that can be enhanced by lenalidomide, providing the framework for clinical evaluation of combination therapy.",easy,Lenalidomide enhances Immune Checkpoint Blockade-Induced Immune Response in Multiple Myeloma by modulating the STAT3 signaling pathway.,Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution

Is methylation of homeobox genes a frequent and early epigenetic event in breast cancer?,"['Aberrant methylation of CpG islands is a hallmark of cancer and occurs at an early stage in breast tumorigenesis. However, its impact on tumor development is not fully determined, and its potential as a diagnostic biomarker remains to be validated. Methylation profiling of invasive breast carcinoma has been largely explored. Conversely, very little and sparse information is available on early-stage breast cancer. To gain insight into the epigenetic switches that may promote and/or contribute to the initial neoplastic events during breast carcinogenesis, we have analyzed the DNA methylation profile of ductal carcinoma in situ, a premalignant breast lesion with a great potential to progress toward invasive carcinoma.'

Does glutamine deprivation induce abortive s-phase rescued by deoxyribonucleotides in k-ras transformed fibroblasts?,"['Oncogene activation plays a role in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. We have previously shown that K-ras transformed fibroblasts have a stronger dependence on glycolysis and a reduced oxidative phosphorylation ability as compared to their normal counterparts. Another metabolic adaptation of cancer cells, that has long been established, is their propensity to exhibit increased glutamine consumption, although the effects induced by glutamine deprivation on cancer cells are still controversial.'
 'Here, by using nutritional perturbations and molecular physiology, we show that reduction or complete depletion of glutamine availability in K-ras transformed fibroblasts causes a strong decrease of proliferation ability and a slower re-entry of synchronized cells into the cell cycle. The reduced proliferation is accompanied by sustained expression of cyclin D and E, abortive S phase entrance and is dependent on Ras signalling deregulation, since it is rescued by expression of a dominant negative guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The growth potential of transformed cells as well as the ability to execute the G(1) to S transition is restored by adding the four deoxyribonucleotides, indicating that the arrest of proliferation of K-ras transformed cells induced by glutamine depletion is largely due to a reduced supply of DNA in the presence of signalling pathways promoting G(1) to S transition.']","Our results suggest that the differential effects of glutamine and glucose on cell viability are not a property of the transformed phenotype per se, but rather depend on the specific pathway being activated in transformation. For instance, myc-overexpressing cells have been reported to die under glutamine depletion and not under glucose shortage, while the opposite holds for ras-transformed fibroblasts as shown in this paper. These different responses of transformed cells to nutritional stress should be taken into account when designing anti-cancer therapies that aim to exploit metabolic differences between normal and transformed cells.",hard,"Glutamine deprivation induces an increase in oxidative stress within K-ras transformed fibroblasts, which is partially rescued by the addition of deoxyribonucleotides through the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes.",Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution

Does complement receptor-3 negatively regulate the phagocytosis of degenerated myelin through tyrosine kinase Syk and cofilin?,"['Intact myelin, which normally surrounds axons, breaks down in Wallerian degeneration following axonal injury and during neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Clearance of degenerated myelin by phagocytosis is essential since myelin impedes repair and exacerbates damage. CR3 (complement receptor-3) is a principal phagocytic receptor in myelin phagocytosis. We studied how tyrosine kinase Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and cofilin control phagocytosis of degenerated myelin by CR3 in microglia and macrophages. Syk is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that CR3 recruits to convey cellular functions. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing protein that controls F-actin (filamentous actin) remodeling (i.e., disassembly and reassembly) by shifting between active unphosphorylated and inactive phosphorylated states.'
 'Syk was continuously activated during prolonged phagocytosis. Phagocytosis increased when Syk activity and expression were reduced, suggesting that normally Syk down regulates CR3-mediated myelin phagocytosis. Levels of inactive p-cofilin (phosphorylated cofilin) decreased transiently during prolonged phagocytosis. In contrast, p-cofilin levels decreased continuously when Syk activity and expression were continuously reduced, suggesting that normally Syk advances the inactive state of cofilin. Observations also revealed inverse relationships between levels of phagocytosis and levels of inactive p-cofilin, suggesting that active unphosphorylated cofilin advances phagocytosis. Active cofilin could advance phagocytosis by promoting F-actin remodeling, which supports the production of membrane protrusions (e.g., filopodia), which, as we also revealed, are instrumental in myelin phagocytosis.']","CR3 both activates and downregulates myelin phagocytosis at the same time. Activation was previously documented. We presently demonstrate that downregulation is mediated through Syk, which advances the inactive phosphorylated state of cofilin. Self-negative control of phagocytosis by the phagocytic receptor can be useful in protecting phagocytes from excessive phagocytosis (i.e., ""overeating"") during extended exposure to particles that are destined for ingestion.",hard,"Complement receptor-3 (CR3) negatively regulates the phagocytosis of degenerated myelin through the actions of tyrosine kinase Syk and cofilin. Specifically, Syk is recruited upon CR3 engagement and phosphorylates cofilin, leading to its inactivation and subsequent suppression of phagocytosis. This mechanism ensures that phagocytes do not excessively engage in phagocytosis, thus preserving cellular function and preventing potential overactivity.",Misinterpretation of #Question#

 'Adult mongrel dogs (n = 25) underwent a median sternotomy and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. In groups 1, 2, and 3, through a right atriotomy, a suture line was placed to simulate the lateral tunnel of the modified Fontan operation (n = 20).

Does modulation of Lactobacillus plantarum gastrointestinal robustness by fermentation conditions enable identification of bacterial robustness markers?,"['Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are applied worldwide in the production of a variety of fermented food products. Additionally, specific Lactobacillus species are nowadays recognized for their health-promoting effects on the consumer.

 'In the accompanying manuscript by Bron et al. the probiotic model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was cultured under different fermentation conditions, which was complemented by the determination of the corresponding molecular responses by full-genome transcriptome analyses. Here, the gastrointestinal (GI) survival of the cultures produced was assessed in an in vitro assay. Variations in fermentation conditions led to dramatic differences in GI-tract survival (up to 7-log) and high robustness could be associated with low salt and low pH during the fermentations. Moreover, random forest correlation analyses allowed the identification of specific transcripts associated with robustness. Subsequently, the corresponding genes were targeted by genetic engineering, aiming to enhance robustness, which could be achieved for 3 of the genes that negatively correlated with robustness and where deletion derivatives displayed enhanced survival compared to the parental strain. Specifically, a role in GI-tract survival could be confirmed for the lp_1669-encoded AraC-family transcription regulator, involved in capsular polysaccharide remodeling, the penicillin-binding protein Pbp2A involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NapA3.

We found that ERP transitions at the border between normal ventricular cells (NZ) with different ERPs are smooth, whereas ERP transitions between NZ and infarct border zone cells (IZ) are abrupt.

ERP heterogeneities between NZ and IZ cells are more vulnerable to block and initiation of reentrant impulses than ERP heterogeneities between NZ cells. The relationship between coupling intervals of premature impulses (V1V2) and coupling intervals between premature and first reentrant impulses (V2T1) at NZ/NZ and NZ/IZ borders is inverse (i.e. the longer the coupling intervals of premature impulses the shorter the coupling interval between the premature and first reentrant impulses); this is in contrast with the reported V1V2/V2T1 relationship measured during initiation of reentrant impulses in canine infarcted hearts which is direct.']","(1) ERP transitions at the NZ-IZ border are abrupt as a consequence of PRR; (2) PRR increases the vulnerability to block and initiation of reentrant impulses in heterogeneous myocardium; (3) V1V2/V2T1 relationships measured at ERP heterogeneities in the computer model and in experimental canine infarcts are not consistent.

We show that CD36, a transmembrane receptor that coordinately modulates multiple protumorigenic phenotypes, including adipocyte differentiation, angiogenesis, cell-ECM interactions, and immune signaling, is greatly repressed in multiple cell types of disease-free stroma associated with high mammographic density and tumor stroma. Using both in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that CD36 repression is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the above-mentioned phenotypes observed in high mammographic density and tumor tissues.

Does human TM9SF4 be a New Gene Down-Regulated by Hypoxia and Involved in Cell Adhesion of Leukemic Cells?,"['The transmembrane 9 superfamily protein member 4, TM9SF4, belongs to the TM9SF family of proteins highly conserved through evolution. TM9SF4 homologs, previously identified in many different species, were mainly involved in cellular adhesion, innate immunity and phagocytosis. In human, the function and biological significance of TM9SF4 are currently under investigation. However, TM9SF4 was found overexpressed in human metastatic melanoma and in a small subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) and myelodysplastic syndromes, consistent with an oncogenic function of this gene.'
 'In this study, we first analyzed the expression and regulation of TM9SF4 in normal and leukemic cells and identified TM9SF4 as a gene highly expressed in human quiescent CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), regulated during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of HPCs, both lineages giving rise to mature myeloid cells involved in adhesion, phagocytosis and immunity. Then, we found that TM9SF4 is markedly overexpressed in leukemic cells and in AMLs, particularly in M2, M3 and M4 AMLs (i.e., in AMLs characterized by the presence of a more or less differentiated granulocytic progeny), as compared to normal CD34+ HPCs. Proliferation and differentiation of HPCs occurs in hypoxia, a physiological condition in bone marrow, but also a crucial component of cancer microenvironment. Here, we investigated the impact of hypoxia on TM9SF4 expression in leukemic cells and identified TM9SF4 as a direct target of HIF-1α, downregulated in these cells by hypoxia. Then, we found that the hypoxia-mediated downregulation of TM9SF4 expression is associated with a decrease of cell adhesion of leukemic cells to fibronectin, thus demonstrating that human TM9SF4 is a new molecule involved in leukemic cell adhesion.']","Altogether, our study reports for the first time the expression of TM9SF4 at the level of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells and its marked expression at the level of AMLs displaying granulocytic differentiation.",hard,Human TM9SF4 is down-regulated by hypoxia and plays a significant role in decreasing cell adhesion of leukemic cells.,Misinterpretation of #Question#

Does long noncoding RNA DANCR increase stemness features of hepatocellular carcinoma by derepression of CTNNB1?,"['Tumor cells with stemness (stem-cell) features contribute to initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains largely unclear. Genome-wide analyses were applied to identify tumor-associated lncRNA-DANCR. DANCR expression level and prognostic values of DANCR were assayed in two HCC cohorts (China and Korea, n = 135 and 223). Artificial modulation of DANCR (down- and overexpression) was done to explore the role of DANCR in tumorigenesis and colonization, and tumor-bearing mice were used to determine therapeutic effects. We found that lncRNA-DANCR is overexpressed in stem-like HCC cells, and this can serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients. Experiments showed that DANCR markedly increased stemness features of HCC cells to promote tumorigenesis and intra-/extrahepatic tumor colonization. Conversely, DANCR knockdown attenuated the stem-cell properties and in vivo interference with DANCR action led to decreased tumor cell vitality, tumor shrinkage, and improved mouse survival. Additionally, we found that the role of DANCR relied largely on an association with, and regulation of, CTNNB1. Association of DANCR with CTNNB1 blocked the repressing effect of microRNA (miR)-214, miR-320a, and miR-199a on CTNNB1.

Is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 4-calculated glomerular filtration rate a better prognostic factor of cardiovascular events than classical cardiovascular risk factors in patients with peripheral arterial disease?,"['Risk prediction is important in medical management, especially to optimize patient management before surgical intervention. No quantitative risk scores or predictors are available for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgical risk and prognosis are usually based on anesthetic scores or clinical evaluation. We suggest that renal function is a better predictor of risk than other cardiovascular parameters.

The following risk factors were evaluated: age, sex, ischemic heart disease, ictus (as a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease related to systemic arterial disease), diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type of vascular intervention, and urea and creatinine plasma levels. The GFR was calculated using the MDRD-4 equation. Death, major cardiovascular events, and reintervention for arterial disease were recorded during the follow-up.'

Does increased skeletal muscle capillarization after aerobic exercise training and weight loss improve insulin sensitivity in adults with IGT?,"['Transcapillary transport of insulin is one determinant of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle; thus, a reduction in capillary density (CD) may worsen insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle CD is lower in older adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared with those with normal glucose tolerance and may be modifiable through aerobic exercise training and weight loss (AEX+WL). We tested the hypothesis that 6-month AEX+WL would increase CD to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in older adults with IGT.'

Does oxygenation decrease elastin secretion from rat ductus arteriosus smooth muscle cells?,"['The ductus arteriosus (DA), a fetal arterial connection between the main pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, normally closes immediately after birth. The oxygen concentration in the blood rises after birth, and in the DA this increase in oxygen concentration causes functional closure, which is induced by smooth muscle contraction.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the rise in oxygen concentration would affect the vascular structure of the DA due to production of proteins secreted from DA smooth muscle cells (SMC).'
 'Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to comprehensively investigate the secreted proteins in the supernatant of rat DA SMC harvested under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) or under normoxic conditions (21% oxygen).

Does cigarette smoke suppress in vitro allergic activation of mouse mast cells?,"['Mast cells are important effector cells in innate or acquired immunity that contribute to host defence. Excessive activation of mast cells can result in the development of allergic diseases, including atopic asthma. Mast cell activation by IgE and specific antigen induces the cells to release spasmogenic, vasoactive and pro-inflammatory mediators, which enhance airway smooth muscle contraction, vascular permeability and inflammatory cell recruitment. Recently, we have demonstrated that exposure of mast cells to cigarette smoke medium (CSM) triggered mast cells to produce chemokines. On the other hand, smoking may decrease the risk of allergic sensitization, which could be explained by a reduced IgE production or a diminished response of mast cells to activation of the IgE receptor.'
 'In this study, we investigated the effect of CSM on the allergic activation of mast cells through IgE and antigen.'
 'Primary cultured murine mast cells were exposed to CSM and activated with IgE and antigen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Out of 26 free flaps, 23 were utilised for acute burn reconstruction while only 3 free flaps were utilised for secondary burn reconstruction. All 26 free flaps survived regardless of timing or burn injury mechanism. Complications included haematomas in 2 flaps and tip necrosis in 4 flaps. Two flaps required debridement and drainage of pus, 1 flap required redo of the venous anastomosis while 1 required redo of the arterial anastomosis with a vein graft.']","Free tissue transfer has a small but definite role within acute and secondary burn reconstruction surgery. Despite the complexity of the burn defects involved, free flaps appear to have a high success rate within this cohort of patients.

Is salt tolerance evolutionarily labile in a diverse set of angiosperm families?,"['Salt tolerance in plants is rare, yet it is found across a diverse set of taxonomic groups. This suggests that, although salt tolerance often involves a set of complex traits, it has evolved many times independently in different angiosperm lineages. However, the pattern of evolution of salt tolerance can vary dramatically between families. A recent phylogenetic study of the Chenopodiaceae (goosefoot family) concluded that salt tolerance has a conserved evolutionary pattern, being gained early in the evolution of the lineage then retained by most species in the family. Conversely, a phylogenetic study of the Poaceae (grass family) suggested over 70 independent gains of salt tolerance, most giving rise to only one or a few salt tolerant species. Here, we use a phylogenetic approach to explore the macroevolutionary patterns of salt tolerance in a sample of angiosperm families, in order to ask whether either of these two patterns - deep and conserved or shallow and labile - represents a common mode of salt tolerance evolution. We analyze the distribution of halophyte species across the angiosperms and identify families with more or less halophytes than expected under a random model. Then, we explore the phylogenetic distribution of halophytes in 22 families using phylogenetic comparative methods.'
 'We find that salt tolerance species have been reported from over one-third of angiosperm families, but that salt tolerant species are not distributed evenly across angiosperm families. We find that salt tolerance has been gained hundreds of times over the history of the angiosperms. In a few families, we find deep and conserved gains of salt tolerance, but in the majority of families analyzed, we find that the pattern of salt tolerant species is best explained by multiple independent gains that occur near the tips of the phylogeny and often give rise to only one or a few halophytes.']",Our results suggest that the pattern of many independent gains of salt tolerance near the tips of the phylogeny is found in many angiosperm families.

 'To investigate the role of HDACs in platelets, we examined the effects of SIRT inhibition on platelet function and protein acetylation in human platelets.'
 'We used washed platelets obtained from healthy subjects. Cambinol (SIRT1 and SIRT2 inhibitor), AGK2 (specific SIRT2 inhibitor) and EX527 (specific SIRT1 inhibitor) were used as SIRT inhibitors.

Protein acetylation and phosphorylation were assessed by immunoblotting.'
 'SIRT inhibition remarkably reduced platelet responses (aggregation, granule release, and cytosolic calcium level; P\xa0<\xa00.05). SIRT2 was present in platelets at the level of mRNA and protein, and its specific inhibition reduced platelet responses. The acetylated protein pattern observed in resting platelets changed during platelet aggregation. Inhibition of SIRT2 increased the acetylation of Akt kinase, which in turn blocked agonist-induced Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, which are markers of Akt activity. Finally, collagen-induced aggregation provoked Akt acetylation.']","Regulation of protein acetylation by SIRT2 plays a central role in platelet function. The effects of SIRT2 are mediated in part by the acetylation and inhibition of Akt.

Does a novel survival-based tissue microarray of pancreatic cancer validate MUC1 and mesothelin as biomarkers?,"[""One-fifth of patients with seemingly 'curable' pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) experience an early recurrence and death, receiving no definable benefit from a major operation. Some patients with advanced stage tumors are deemed 'unresectable' by conventional staging criteria (e.g. liver metastasis), yet progress slowly. Effective biomarkers that stratify PDA based on biologic behavior are needed. To help researchers sort through the maze of biomarker data, a compendium of ∼2500 published candidate biomarkers in PDA was compiled (PLoS Med, 2009. 6(4) p. e1000046).""

 'Accordingly, we have measured the main cellular components of muscle growth and regeneration over the period of postnatal growth and early pathology in mdx and wild-type (WT) mice; phalloidin binding is used as a measure of fibre size, myonuclear counts and BrdU labelling as records of myogenic activity.'
 'We confirm a two-phase postnatal growth pattern in WT muscle: first, increase in myonuclear number over weeks 1 to 3, then expansion of myonuclear domain. Mdx muscle growth lags behind that of WT prior to overt signs of pathology. Fibres are smaller, with fewer myonuclei and smaller myonuclear domains. Moreover, satellite cells are more readily detached from mdx than WT muscle fibres. At 3\xa0weeks, mdx muscles enter a phase of florid myonecrosis, accompanied by concurrent regeneration of an intensity that results in complete replacement of pre-existing muscle over the succeeding 3 to 4\xa0weeks. Both WT and mdx muscles attain maximum size by 12 to 14\xa0weeks, mdx muscle fibres being up to 50% larger than those of WT as they become increasingly branched.

 'Acetylcholine treatment during reoxygenation prevented intracellular and mitochondrial Ca(2+) increases and alleviated ER Ca(2+) depletion during H/R in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Consequently, acetylcholine enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited proapoptotic cascades, thereby reducing cell death and preserving endothelial ultrastructure. This effect was likely mediated by the type-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In addition, interactions among members of the VDAC1/glucose-regulated protein 75/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 complex were increased after H/R and were associated with mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and cell death. Inhibition of the partner of the Ca(2+) channeling complex (VDAC1 siRNA) or a reduction in ER-mitochondria tethering (mitofusin 2 siRNA) prevented the increased protein interaction within the complex and reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation and subsequent endothelial cell death after H/R.

Thirty-minute pacing followed by 15-minute sinus rhythm resulted in modest reductions in infarct size (71 +/- 2%, P<.05 versus control). Thirty minutes of pacing immediately preceding the occlusion without intervening sinus rhythm resulted in considerable limitation of infarct size (63 +/- 4%, P<.05), which was abolished by pretreatment with the KATP+ channel blocker glibenclamide (78 +/- 4%, P=NS).

Does niche-associated activation of rac promote the asymmetric division of Drosophila female germline stem cells?,"['Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) reside adjacent to a cellular niche that secretes Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligands and anchors the GSCs through adherens junctions.

We first use a modified biosensor to demonstrate that the small GTPase Rac is asymmetrically activated within the GSC at the niche-GSC interface. Experiments using loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in Rac indicate that asymmetric Rac activity both localizes the microtubule binding protein Apc2 to orient one GSC centrosome at the niche-GSC interface during interphase and activates the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway to increase the ability of the GSC to respond to BMP ligands.

Do contributions of gut bacteria to Bacillus thuringiensis-induced mortality vary across a range of Lepidoptera?,"['Gut microbiota contribute to the health of their hosts, and alterations in the composition of this microbiota can lead to disease. Previously, we demonstrated that indigenous gut bacteria were required for the insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis to kill the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar.

A variety of factors associated with the insect host, B. thuringiensis strain, and environment affect the wide range of susceptibilities among Lepidoptera, but the interaction of gut bacteria with these factors is not understood. To assess the contribution of gut bacteria to B. thuringiensis susceptibility across a range of Lepidoptera we examined larval mortality of six species in the presence and absence of their indigenous gut bacteria.

Antibiotics eliminated populations of gut bacteria below detectable levels in each of the insects, with the exception of H. virescens, which did not have detectable gut bacteria prior to treatment. Oral administration of the Gram-negative Enterobacter sp. NAB3, an indigenous gut resident of L. dispar, restored larval mortality in all four of the species in which antibiotics both reduced susceptibility to B. thuringiensis and eliminated gut bacteria, but not in H. virescens.

Are expression of excess receptors and negative feedback control of signal pathways required for rapid activation and prompt cessation of signal transduction?,"['Cellular signal transduction is initiated by the binding of extracellular ligands to membrane receptors.

 'To answer these questions, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation program to kinetically analyze signal pathways using the model in which ligands are bound to receptors and then membrane complexes with other membrane proteins are formed. Our simulation results showed that excess receptors are not required for cell activation when the dissociation constant (Kd) of the ligand-receptor complex is 10-10 M or less. However, such low Kd values cause delayed signal shutdown after ligand clearance from the extracellular space. In contrast, when the Kd was 10-8 M and the ligand level was less than 1 muM, excess receptors were required for prompt signal propagation and rapid signal cessation after ligand clearance. An initial increase in active cytosolic signal proteins to a high level is required for rapid activation of cellular signal pathways, and a low level of active signal proteins is essential for the rapid shutdown of signal pathways after ligand clearance.']",The present kinetic analysis revealed that excess receptors and negative feedback regulation promote activation and cessation of signal transduction with a low amount of extracellular ligand.,hard,"Excess G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) facilitate rapid signal transduction initiation and termination through enhanced ligand binding and internalization, respectively.",Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution

Therefore, measurement of heart rate variability may be useful to assess the effect of epidural anesthesia on cardiac autonomic tone.

Specifically, the hypothesis that cardiac sympathetic blockade attenuates low-frequency spectral power, assumed to reflect cardiac sympathetic modulation, was tested.'
 'Ten subjects were studied while supine and during a 15-min 40 degrees head-up tilt both before and after cardiac sympathetic blockade by segmental thoracic epidural anesthesia (sensory block: C6-T6). ECG, arterial pressure, and respiratory excursion (Whitney gauge) were recorded, and a fast-Fourier-transformation was applied to 512-s data segments of heart rate derived from the digitized ECG at the end of each intervention.'
 'With cardiac sympathetic blockade alone and the subjects supine, both low-frequency (LF, 0.06-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.80 Hz) spectral power remained unchanged. During tilt, epidural anesthesia attenuated the evoked increase in heart rate (+11.min-1 +/- 7 SD vs. +6 +/- 7, P = 0.024). However, while during tilt cardiac sympathetic blockade significantly decreased the LF/HF ratio (3.68 +/- 2.52 vs. 2.83 +/- 2.15, P = 0.041 vs. tilt before sympathetic blockade), a presumed marker of sympathovagal interaction, absolute and fractional LF and HF power did not change.']","Although preganglionic cardiac sympathetic blockade reduced the LF/HF ratio during tilt, it did not alter spectral power in the LF band during rest or tilt.

"Is expression of PaNAC01 , a Picea abies CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON orthologue , regulated by polar auxin transport and associated with differentiation of the shoot apical meristem and formation of separated cotyledons?","['During embryo development in most gymnosperms, the establishment of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) occurs concomitantly with the formation of a crown of cotyledons surrounding the SAM.

 'To investigate whether blood granulocytes and monocytes could determine luminal renarrowing after PTCA, several characteristics of these phagocytes were assessed before angioplasty in 32 patients who underwent PTCA of one coronary artery and who had repeat angiograms at 6-month follow-up. The plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein(a) before angioplasty were assessed as well. We found that the expression of the membrane antigens CD64, CD66, and CD67 by granulocytes was inversely associated with the luminal renarrowing normalized for vessel size (relative loss) at 6 months after PTCA, while the production of IL-1 beta by stimulated monocytes was positively associated with the relative loss. Next, these univariate predictors were corrected for the established clinical risk factors of dilation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and current smoking, which were statistically significant classic predictors in our patient group. Only the expression of CD67 did not predict late lumen loss independent of these established clinical risk factors. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that luminal renarrowing could be predicted reliably (R2 = .65; P < .0001) in this patient group on the basis of the vessel dilated and only two biological risk factors that reflect the activation status of blood phagocytes, ie, the expression of CD66 by granulocytes and the production of IL-1 beta by stimulated monocytes.']","The results of the present study indicate that activated blood granulocytes prevent luminal renarrowing after PTCA, while activated blood monocytes promote late lumen loss.

Is persistent smoking after a diagnosis of lung cancer associated with higher reported pain levels?,"['The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of smoking status after a diagnosis of lung cancer on reported pain levels. We conducted a telephone survey of patients with lung cancer identified from 4 participating sites between September 2004 and July 2006.

We operationally defined persistent smokers as patients who reported continuing to smoke after their lung cancer diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis that persistent smokers report higher usual pain levels than nonsmokers. Overall, 893 patients completed the survey. The majority (76%) was found to have advanced cancer (stages IIIb and IV). The mean age was 63 years (SD = 10). Seventeen percent of the patients studied were categorized as persistent smokers. The mean pain score for the study sample was 3.1 (SD = 2.7) and 41% reported moderate (4 to 6) or severe pain (7 to 10). A greater proportion of persistent smokers reported moderate or severe pain than nonsmokers or former smokers (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking status was associated with the usual pain even after adjusting for age, perceived health status, and other lung cancer symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and trouble eating.

Staphylococcus aureus that produce PVL are responsible for severe diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the target cells of PVL action. The goal of this study was to elucidate the effect of a group of α-defensins known as the human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) on the interactions between LukS-PV and LukF-PV, which compose PVL, and human PMNs. We observed that HNPs bound to both subunits of PVL and significantly decreased PVL pore formation in PMNs, with a maximum inhibition of 27%. When various HNP molecules were tested individually under the same conditions, we observed that HNP3, but not HNP1 or 2, decreased pore formation.

Citrulline formation and cytochrome c reduction assays revealed that in comparison with nNOS or iNOS, eNOS was less stringent in the requirement of calcium binding to each of four calcium-binding sites. However, lobe-specific disruption with double mutations in calcium-binding sites either at N- (B12Q) or at C-terminal (B34Q) lobes greatly diminished both eNOS oxygenase and reductase activities. Gel mobility shift assay and flavin fluorescence measurement indicated that N- and C-lobes of CaM played distinct roles in regulating eNOS catalysis; the C-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form was responsible for the binding of canonical CaM-binding domain, while N-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form controlled the movement of FMN domain. Limited proteolysis studies further demonstrated that B12Q and B34Q induced different conformational change in eNOS.']",Our results clearly demonstrate that CaM controls eNOS electron transfer primarily through its lobe-specific calcium binding.,hard,Calcium binding to individual EF-hands in calmodulin regulates eNOS activation independently of lobe specificity.,Misinterpretation of #Question#

 'Of the 190 patients, 111 (58%) responded to HFOV (HFOV responders), and 79 (42%) were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after HFOV failed to improve gas exchange (nonresponders). The two groups were similar in gender and birth weight. Factors associated with failure of HFOV to produce a sustained improvement in gas exchange were a diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and more severe respiratory compromise as assessed by admission blood gas. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that a diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia/lung hypoplasia (CDH/LH) and the a/A ratio at initiation of and after 6 hours of HFOV were the only significant independent predictors of the need for ECMO. Among all the patients, the presence of CDH/LH or an initial a/A ratio of 0.05 or lower yielded a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 77% in correctly identifying neonates in whom HFOV failed to produce a sustained improvement in oxygenation. When neonates with CDH/LH were excluded from analysis, the most significant predictor of failure of HFOV was the a/A ratio after 6 hours of HFOV.

Do diploid males support a two-step mechanism of endosymbiont-induced thelytoky in a parasitoid wasp?,"['Haplodiploidy, where females develop from diploid, fertilized eggs and males from haploid, unfertilized eggs, is abundant in some insect lineages. Some species in these lineages reproduce by thelytoky that is caused by infection with endosymbionts: infected females lay haploid eggs that undergo diploidization and develop into females, while males are very rare or absent. It is generally assumed that in thelytokous wasps, endosymbionts merely diploidize the unfertilized eggs, which would then trigger female development.'
 'We found that females in the parasitoid wasp Asobara japonica infected with thelytoky-inducing Wolbachia produce 0.7-1.2% male offspring. Seven to 39% of these males are diploid, indicating that diploidization and female development can be uncoupled in A. japonica. Wolbachia titer in adults was correlated with their ploidy and sex: diploids carried much higher Wolbachia titers than haploids, and diploid females carried more Wolbachia than diploid males. Data from introgression lines indicated that the development of diploid individuals into males instead of females is not caused by malfunction-mutations in the host genome but that diploid males are most likely produced when the endosymbiont fails to activate the female sex determination pathway. Our data therefore support a two-step mechanism by which endosymbionts induce thelytoky in A. japonica: diploidization of the unfertilized egg is followed by feminization, whereby each step correlates with a threshold of endosymbiont titer during wasp development.']","Our new model of endosymbiont-induced thelytoky overthrows the view that certain sex determination mechanisms constrain the evolution of endosymbiont-induced thelytoky in hymenopteran insects. Endosymbionts can cause parthenogenesis through feminization, even in groups in which endosymbiont-diploidized eggs would develop into males following the hosts' sex determination mechanism. In addition, our model broadens our understanding of the mechanisms by which endosymbionts induce thelytoky to enhance their transmission to the next generation.

Does ancestral reconstruction of reproductive traits show no tendency toward terrestriality in leptodactyline frogs?,"['Traditionally, the evolution of terrestrial reproduction in anurans from ancestors that bred in water has been accepted in the literature. Still, the existence of intermediate stages of water dependency, such as species that lay eggs close to water (e.g., in burrows) instead of in bodies of water, supports the hypothesis of an ordered and gradual evolution in the direction of a more terrestrial form of reproduction. However, this conventional view has recently been challenged for some anurans groups. Leptodactylinae frogs are a remarkable example of anurans with an outstanding diversity in terms of reproductive features, with distinct water dependency among lineages. Here, we tested the hypothesis of a gradual and ordered tendency towards terrestriality in Leptodactylinae, including the existence of obligatory intermediate stages, such as semi-terrestrial reproductive strategies. We also addressed the association between reproductive modes and the morphological and ecological features.'
 'An ancestral reconstruction analysis indicated that even though shifts from aquatic to terrestrial breeding occurred throughout the history of Leptodactylus and Adenomera, shifts from terrestrial to aquatic reproduction happened at almost the same frequency. Our results also demonstrated that reproductive modes for semi-terrestrial tadpoles were not necessarily an intermediate form between aquatic and terrestrial breeds. Correlations among reproductive modes and other life-history traits suggested that tadpole environment, clutch size, nuptial spines, and egg pigmentation were co-evolving and driven by water dependency.']","Our results found no evidence of evolutionary tendencies toward terrestriality in Leptodactylinae. We found reversals from terrestrial to aquatic tadpole development and no evidence of obligatory intermediate stages, such as semi-terrestrial reproductive strategies.

Do extracellular IgC2 constant domains of CEACAMs mediate PI3K sensitivity during uptake of pathogens?,"['Several pathogenic bacteria utilize receptors of the CEACAM family to attach to human cells. Binding to different members of this receptor family can result in uptake of the bacteria. Uptake of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative human pathogen, via CEACAMs found on epithelial cells, such as CEACAM1, CEA or CEACAM6, differs mechanistically from phagocytosis mediated by CEACAM3, a CEACAM family member expressed selectively by human granulocytes.'
 ""We find that CEACAM1- as well as CEACAM3-mediated bacterial internalization are accompanied by a rapid increase in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P) at the site of bacterial entry. However, pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI3K) selectively affects CEACAM1-mediated uptake of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Accordingly, overexpression of the PI(3,4,5)P phosphatase SHIP diminishes and expression of a constitutive active PI3K increases CEACAM1-mediated internalization of gonococci, without influencing uptake by CEACAM3. Furthermore, bacterial uptake by GPI-linked members of the CEACAM family (CEA and CEACAM6) and CEACAM1-mediated internalization of N. meningitidis by endothelial cells require PI3K activity. Sensitivity of CEACAM1-mediated uptake toward PI3K inhibition is independent of receptor localization in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains and does not require the cytoplasmic or the transmembrane domain of CEACAM1. However, PI3K inhibitor sensitivity requires the Ig(C2)-like domains of CEACAM1, which are also present in CEA and CEACAM6, but which are absent from CEACAM3.

Do volatile organic compounds enhance allergic airway inflammation in an experimental mouse model?,"['Epidemiological studies suggest an association between exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and adverse allergic and respiratory symptoms. However, whether VOCs exhibit a causal role as adjuvants in asthma development remains unclear.'
 'To investigate the effect of VOC exposure on the development of allergic airway inflammation Balb/c mice were exposed to VOCs emitted by new polyvinylchloride (PVC) flooring, sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and characterized in acute and chronic murine asthma models. Furthermore, prevalent evaporated VOCs were analyzed and mice were exposed to selected single VOCs.'
 'Exposure of mice to PVC flooring increased eosinophilic lung inflammation and OVA-specific IgE serum levels compared to un-exposed control mice. The increased inflammation was associated with elevated levels of Th2-cytokines. Long-term exposure to PVC flooring exacerbated chronic airway inflammation. VOCs with the highest concentrations emitted by new PVC flooring were N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate (TXIB). Exposure to NMP or TXIB also increased the allergic immune response in OVA-sensitized mice. In vitro or in vivo exposure to NMP or TXIB reduced IL-12 production in maturing dendritic cells (DCs) and enhanced airway inflammation after adoptive DC transfer into Balb/c mice. At higher concentrations both VOCs induced oxidative stress demonstrated by increased isoprostane and glutathione-S-transferase-pi1 protein levels in the lung of non-sensitized mice. Treatment of PVC flooring-exposed mice with N-acetylcysteine prevented the VOC-induced increase of airway inflammation.']",Our results demonstrate that exposure to VOCs may increase the allergic immune response by interfering with DC function and by inducing oxidative stress and has therefore to be considerate as risk factor for the development of allergic diseases.,hard,"Recent studies indicate that exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly enhance allergic airway inflammation in experimental mouse models by modulating oxidative stress pathways.

"Is synapse formation enhanced by oral administration of uridine and DHA , the circulating precursors of brain phosphatides?","['The loss of cortical and hippocampal synapses is a universal hallmark of Alzheimer\'s disease, and probably underlies its effects on cognition. Synapses are formed from the interaction of neurites projecting from ""presynaptic"" neurons with dendritic spines projecting from ""postsynaptic"" neurons. Both of these structures are vulnerable to the toxic effects of nearby amyloid plaques, and their loss contributes to the decreased number of synapses that characterize the disease. A treatment that increased the formation of neurites and dendritic spines might reverse this loss, thereby increasing the number of synapses and slowing the decline in cognition.'
 'We observe that giving normal rodents uridine and the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) orally can enhance dendritic spine levels (3), and cognitive functions (32). Moreover this treatment also increases levels of biochemical markers for neurites (i.e., neurofilament-M and neurofilament-70) (2) in vivo, and uridine alone increases both these markers and the outgrowth of visible neurites by cultured PC-12 cells (9). A phase 2 clinical trial, performed in Europe, is described briefly.']","Uridine and DHA are circulating precursors for the phosphatides in synaptic membranes, and act in part by increasing the substrate-saturation of enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylcholine from CTP (formed from the uridine, via UTP) and from diacylglycerol species that contain DHA: the enzymes have poor affinities for these substrates, and thus are unsaturated with them, and only partially active, under basal conditions. The enhancement by uridine of neurite outgrowth is also mediated in part by UTP serving as a ligand for neuronal P2Y receptors. Moreover administration of uridine with DHA activates many brain genes, among them the gene for the m-1 metabotropic glutamate receptor [Cansev, et al, submitted]. This activation, in turn, increases brain levels of that gene's protein product and of such other synaptic proteins as PSD-95, synapsin-1, syntaxin-3 and F-actin, but not levels of non-synaptic brain proteins like beta-tubulin. Hence it is possible that giving uridine plus DHA triggers a neuronal program that, by accelerating phosphatide and synaptic protein synthesis, controls synaptogenesis. If administering this mix of phosphatide precursors also increases synaptic elements in brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease, as it does in normal rodents, then this treatment may ameliorate some of the manifestations of the disease.",medium,"Oral administration of uridine and DHA enhances synapse formation by increasing phosphatidylcholine synthesis and promoting neurite outgrowth, thereby improving synaptic density and function. These compounds act synergistically, with uridine facilitating the conversion of CTP to phosphatidylcholine and DHA contributing to diacylglycerol species necessary for synaptic membrane fluidity and receptor function.",Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution
Does β-Catenin regulate deiodinase levels and thyroid hormone signaling in colon cancer cells?,"[""Activation of the β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) complex occurs in most colon tumors, and its actions correlate with the neoplastic phenotype of intestinal epithelial cells.

 'We measured D3 expression in 6 colon cancer cell lines and human tumors and correlated it with the activity of the β-catenin/TCF complex. We also determined the effects of D3 loss on local thyroid hormone signaling and colon tumorigenesis.'
 ""We show that D3 is a direct transcriptional target of the β-catenin/TCF complex; its expression was higher in human intestinal adenomas and carcinomas than in healthy intestinal tissue. Experimental attenuation of β-catenin reduced D3 levels and induced type 2 deiodinase (the D3 antagonist that converts 3,5,3',5' tetraiodothyronine into active T3) thereby increasing T3-dependent transcription. In the absence of D3, excess T3 reduced cell proliferation and promoted differentiation in cultured cells and in xenograft mouse models. This occurred via induction of E-cadherin, which sequestered β-catenin at the plasma membrane and promoted cell differentiation.""]",Deiodinases are at the interface between the β-catenin and the thyroid hormone pathways.

We validated the DNase I mapping approach for identification of CNS enhancers using the existing VISTA Browser database and with in vivo and in vitro electroporation of the retina. Analysis of transcription factor consensus sites within the DHSs shows distinct region-specific profiles of transcriptional regulators particular to each region. Clustering developmentally dynamic DHSs in the retina revealed enrichment of developmental stage-specific transcriptional regulators.

"Are the coiled coils of cohesin conserved in animals , but not in yeast?","['The SMC proteins are involved in DNA repair, chromosome condensation, and sister chromatid cohesion throughout Eukaryota. Long, anti-parallel coiled coils are a prominent feature of SMC proteins, and are thought to serve as spacer rods to provide an elongated structure and to separate domains. We reported recently that the coiled coils of mammalian condensin (SMC2/4) showed moderate sequence divergence (approximately 10-15%) consistent with their functioning as spacer rods. The coiled coils of mammalian cohesins (SMC1/3), however, were very highly constrained, with amino acid sequence divergence typically <0.5%. These coiled coils are among the most highly conserved mammalian proteins, suggesting that they make extensive contacts over their entire surface.'
 'Here, we broaden our initial analysis of condensin and cohesin to include additional vertebrate and invertebrate organisms and multiple species of yeast. We found that the coiled coils of SMC1/3 are highly constrained in Drosophila and other insects, and more generally across all animal species.

Since its coiled coils apparently serve only as spacer rods in yeast, it is likely that this is sufficient for sister chromatid cohesion in all species. This suggests an additional function in animals that constrains the sequence of the coiled coils. Several recent studies have demonstrated that cohesin has a role in gene expression in post-mitotic neurons of Drosophila, and other animal cells.

Are terminal 18q deletions stabilized by neotelomeres?,"['All human chromosomes are capped by tandem repeat (TTAGGG)n sequences that protect them against end-to-end fusion and are essential to chromosomal replication and integrity.

We fine-mapped breakpoints with customized arrays and sequenced six terminal deletion junctions. In all six deleted chromosomes sequenced, telomeric sequences were found directly attached to the breakpoints. Little or no microhomology was found at the breakpoints and none of the breaks sequenced were located in low copy repeat (LCR) regions, though repetitive elements were found around the breakpoints in five patients.

Does extracellular matrix modulate sensitivity of hepatocytes to fibroblastoid dedifferentiation and transforming growth factor beta-induced apoptosis?,"['Hepatocytes in culture are a valuable tool to investigate mechanisms involved in the response of the liver to cytokines. However, it is well established that hepatocytes cultured on monolayers of dried stiff collagen dedifferentiate, losing specialized liver functions. In this study, we show that hepatocyte dedifferentiation is a reversible consequence of a specific signaling network constellation triggered by the extracellular matrix. A dried stiff collagen activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) via Src, leading to activation of the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathways. Akt causes resistance to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis by antagonizing p38, whereas ERK1/2 signaling opens the route to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Apoptosis resistance is reversible by inhibiting Akt or Src, and EMT can be abrogated by blocking the ERK1/2 pathway. In contrast to stiff collagen, a softer collagen gel does not activate FAK, keeping the hepatocytes in a state where they remain sensitive to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and do not undergo EMT. In this culture system, inhibition of p38 as well as overexpression of constitutively active Akt causes apoptosis resistance, whereas constitutively active Ras induces EMT. Finally, we show that matrix-induced EMT is reversible by replating cells from dried stiff to soft gel collagen. Our results demonstrate that hepatocyte dedifferentiation in vitro is an active process driven by FAK-mediated Akt and ERK1/2 signaling. This leads to similar functional and morphological alterations as observed for regenerating hepatocytes in vivo and is reversible when Akt and/or ERK1/2 signaling pathways are antagonized.']",Hepatocytes can exist in a differentiated and a dedifferentiated state that are reversible and can be switched by manipulating the responsible key factors of the signaling network.,hard,Extracellular matrix components significantly enhance hepatocytes' resistance to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis by upregulating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB).,Misinterpretation of #Question#

Do reduced UDP-glucose Levels Are Associated with P-glycoprotein Over-expression in L1210 Cells and Limit Glucosylceramide Synthase Activity?,"['P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression in neoplastic cells is known to reduce cell sensitivity to several cytotoxic Pgp substrates. A member of the ABC transporter family, Pgp, represents the most frequently described membrane efflux pump and its expression in neoplastic cells is responsible for multi-drug resistance. Several lines of evidence indicate that the expression and increased function of both Pgp and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS, an enzyme responsible for ceramide pathway de-activation in the regulation of apoptosis progression) enhance the resistance of Pgp-positive cells. Previously, we described a reduction in the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose contents of mouse leukemia cells (R) expressing Pgp due to vincristine selection compared to parental L1210 cells (S). The reduced availability of UDP-glucose as a glucose donor in R cell glycosylation reactions could limit GCS-catalyzed ceramide glycosylation. Consequently, the over-expression of Pgp in Pgp-positive L1210 cells may be associated with reduced ceramide glycosylation.'
 'To test this idea, we measured the expression and activities of Pgp and GCS, UDP-glucose levels, cellular uptake of C12-NBD-ceramide (a fluorescent analogue of ceramide) and ceramide-induced cell death in S and R cells. T-cells, another Pgp-positive variant of L1210 cells that express Pgp due to their transfection with a gene encoding human Pgp were also used in this study.'
 'We detected significantly reduced levels of C12-NBD-ceramide glycosylation and reduced UDP-glucose contents in Pgp-positive R and T-cells compared to S cells. C12-NBD-ceramide uptake assays revealed nearly identical dynamics of uptake time-dependency curves. The Pgp-positive L1210 variants (R and T) are more sensitive than Pgp-negative S cells to ceramide-induced cell damage, as measured by an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide apoptosis necrosis kit. Short chain C2-ceramide was more effective at inducing cell damage than ceramide analogues with longer chains.']",These evidence indicates that the down-regulation of UDP-glucose contents in Pgp-positive L1210 cells is responsible for their collateral sensitivity to ceramide-induced apoptosis.,medium,"Reduced UDP-glucose levels are associated with increased GCS activity in Pgp-overexpressing L1210 cells, enhancing their resistance to ceramide-induced apoptosis.",Misinterpretation of #Question#

Small thrombi were detected in the IVC of most rats after 15 minutes of ligation. Thrombi were rich in fibrin, contained aggregated platelets as well as trapped leukocytes and red cells, and most originated at sites of localized endothelial denudation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed tissue factor (TF)-expressing leukocytes within the thrombi and adherent to the vessel wall. Despite a largely intact vessel wall, endothelial cells also stained for TF. The expression of TF colocalized with that of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme implicated in TF decryption.']","These findings suggest that the rapid development of DVT after IVC ligation reflects a combination of stasis-induced vein wall injury and enhanced TF expression in endothelial cells and leukocytes. Because TF expression occurs so soon after ligation, new synthesis is unlikely.

Does amino acid racemization reveal differential protein turnover in osteoarthritic articular and meniscal cartilages?,"['Certain amino acids within proteins have been reported to change from the L form to the D form over time. This process is known as racemization and is most likely to occur in long-lived low-turnover tissues such as normal cartilage.

Does p66ShcA modulate oxidative stress and survival of endothelial progenitor cells in response to high glucose?,"['A close relationship exists between hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress, and diabetic complications.

We found that cell culture in the presence of HG up-regulated p66ShcA protein expression and that HG exposure markedly decreased the number of BM-derived EPCs. Conversely, p66ShcA ko BM-derived EPCs were not sensitive to HG inhibition. Indeed, the resistance of p66ShcA ko BM-derived EPCs to HG was associated with reduced levels of both apoptosis and oxidative stress. To functionally link the HG response to ROS production, p66ShcA ko BM-derived EPCs were reconstituted either with p66ShcA wild-type (wt) or with a p66ShcA allele (p66ShcA qq) that was devoid of its ROS-generating function. We found that only p66ShcA wt and not the qq mutant rescued p66ShcA ko cell sensitivity to HG. One major feature of oxidative stress is its ability to reduce the bio-availability of nitric oxide (NO) that, in turn, plays a crucial role in endothelial differentiation and function. We found that the p66ShcA deletion prevented the HG-induced increase of nitrotyrosine, and that the resistance to HG of p66ShcA ko BM-derived EPCs was prevented by NO synthase inhibition.

Do endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors prevent adaptive capillary growth in left ventricular pressure overload hypertrophy?,"['In left ventricular (LV) pressure-overload hypertrophy, lack of adaptive capillary growth contributes to progression to failure. Remodeling of the hypertrophied myocardium requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) carried out by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Does aminoguanidine prevent the decreased myocardial compliance produced by streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in rats?,"['A decreased cardiac compliance is a major feature of the cardiomyopathy of diabetes mellitus. Either an increase in the resistance afterload to the LV or an increase in collagen cross-linking induced by the formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) of collagen may be responsible for the stiff myocardium. To evaluate these hypotheses, we examined the effect of captopril, an afterload-reducing agent, and aminoguanidine, a nucleophilic hydrazine that prevents the accumulation of collagen AGEs, on left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) compliance after 4 months of streptozotocin (0.26 mmol/kg)-induced diabetes mellitus in rats.'
 'Diabetes mellitus produced a decrease in LV chamber compliance as a result of an increased myocardial stiffness (slope of the linearized LVED stress-LVED strain relation [unitless]: diabetes mellitus, 47+/-4; control, 27+/-3; P<.001) and an increase in blood pressure as a result of an elevated vascular resistance. LV end-systolic elastance was unaltered by diabetes mellitus. The stiff myocardium was not associated with changes in the myocardial collagen volume fraction or total hydroxyproline concentration but was associated with an increased myocardial collagen fluorescence (fluorescence units/microg hydroxyproline) (diabetes mellitus, 11+/-1.1; control, 6.6+/-0.7; P<.01). Captopril therapy (0.22 mmol x kg(-1) x d(-1)), despite producing a decrease in blood pressure through alterations in vascular resistance, failed to decrease myocardial stiffness in rats with diabetes mellitus.

Does peripheral nerve injury sensitize neonatal dorsal horn neurons to tumor necrosis factor-alpha?,"['Little is known about whether peripheral nerve injury during the early postnatal period modulates synaptic efficacy in the immature superficial dorsal horn (SDH) of the spinal cord, or whether the neonatal SDH network is sensitive to the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha under neuropathic conditions. Thus we examined the effects of TNFalpha on synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane excitability in developing rat SDH neurons in the absence or presence of sciatic nerve damage.'
 'The spared nerve injury (SNI) model of peripheral neuropathy at postnatal day (P)6 failed to significantly alter miniature excitatory (mEPSCs) or inhibitory (mIPSCs) postsynaptic currents in SDH neurons at P9-11. However, SNI did alter the sensitivity of excitatory synapses in the immature SDH to TNFalpha. While TNFalpha failed to influence mEPSCs or mIPSCs in slices from sham-operated controls, it significantly increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude following SNI without modulating synaptic inhibition onto the same neurons. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs, suggesting TNFalpha increases the probability of glutamate release in the SDH under neuropathic conditions. Similarly, while SNI alone did not alter action potential (AP) threshold or rheobase in SDH neurons at this age, TNFalpha significantly decreased AP threshold and rheobase in the SNI group but not in sham-operated littermates. However, unlike the adult, the expression of TNFalpha in the immature dorsal horn was not significantly elevated during the first week following the SNI.']","Developing SDH neurons become susceptible to regulation by TNFalpha following peripheral nerve injury in the neonate. This may include both a greater efficacy of glutamatergic synapses as well as an increase in the intrinsic excitability of immature dorsal horn neurons. However, neonatal sciatic nerve damage alone did not significantly modulate synaptic transmission or neuronal excitability in the SDH, which could reflect a relatively weak expression of TNFalpha in the injured spinal cord at early ages. The above data suggest that although the sensitivity of the SDH network to proinflammatory cytokines after nerve injury is present from the first days of life, the profile of spinal cytokine expression under neuropathic conditions may be highly age-dependent.",medium,Neonatal dorsal horn neurons become less sensitive to TNFalpha following peripheral nerve injury.,Misinterpretation of #Question#

Is tissue Doppler imaging measurement of left ventricular systolic function in children : mitral annular displacement index superior to peak velocity?,"[""Doppler tissue imaging (DTI)-derived mitral annular systolic peak S-wave velocity (S') correlates with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). The authors hypothesized that DTI mitral annular displacement, which is equal to the velocity-time integral of the DTI S' wave, might be superior to S' to analyze LV systolic function.

Does insulin receptor substrate-1 prevent autophagy-dependent cell death caused by oxidative stress in mouse NIH/3T3 cells?,"['Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is associated with tumorigenesis; its levels are elevated in several human cancers. IRS-1 protein binds to several oncogene proteins. Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the initiation and progression of cancers. Cancer cells produce greater levels of ROS than normal cells do because of increased metabolic stresses. However, excessive production of ROS kills cancer cells. Autophagy usually serves as a survival mechanism in response to stress conditions, but excessive induction of autophagy results in cell death. In addition to inducing necrosis and apoptosis, ROS induces autophagic cell death. ROS inactivates IRS-1 mediated signaling and reduces intracellular IRS-1 concentrations. Thus, there is a complex relationship between IRS-1, ROS, autophagy, and cancer. It is not fully understood how cancer cells grow rapidly and survive in the presence of high ROS levels.'
 'In this study, we established mouse NIH/3T3 cells that overexpressed IRS-1, so mimicking cancers with increased IRS-1 expression levels; we found that the IRS-1 overexpressing cells grow more rapidly than control cells do. Treatment of cells with glucose oxidase (GO) provided a continuous source of ROS; low dosages of GO promoted cell growth, while high doses induced cell death. Evidence for GO induced autophagy includes increased levels of isoform B-II microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), aggregation of green fluorescence protein-tagged LC3, and increased numbers of autophagic vacuoles in cells. Overexpression of IRS-1 resulted in inhibition of basal autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress-induced autophagy and cell death.

Do signaling cascades modulate the speed of signal propagation through space?,"['Cells are not mixed bags of signaling molecules. As a consequence, signals must travel from their origin to distal locations. Much is understood about the purely diffusive propagation of signals through space. Many signals, however, propagate via signaling cascades. Here, we show that, depending on their kinetics, cascades speed up or slow down the propagation of signals through space, relative to pure diffusion.'
 'We modeled simple cascades operating under different limits of Michaelis-Menten kinetics using deterministic reaction-diffusion equations. Cascades operating far from enzyme saturation speed up signal propagation; the second mobile species moves more quickly than the first through space, on average. The enhanced speed is due to more efficient serial activation of a downstream signaling module (by the signaling molecule immediately upstream in the cascade) at points distal from the signaling origin, compared to locations closer to the source. Conversely, cascades operating under saturated kinetics, which exhibit zero-order ultrasensitivity, can slow down signals, ultimately localizing them to regions around the origin.']","Signal speed modulation may be a fundamental function of cascades, affecting the ability of signals to penetrate within a cell, to cross-react with other signals, and to activate distant targets. In particular, enhanced speeds provide a way to increase signal penetration into a cell without needing to flood the cell with large numbers of active signaling molecules; conversely, diminished speeds in zero-order ultrasensitive cascades facilitate strong, but localized, signaling.",medium,Signaling cascades modulate the speed of signal propagation by altering the diffusion coefficient of signaling molecules rather than through kinetic changes in enzymatic reactions.,Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution

This was accompanied by B-cell activation, germinal center formation, and protective antibody responses against influenza. The expansion of TFH cells and antibody responses could be elicited by both systemic and topical skin immunization. TFH cell induction was not restricted to LCs and occurred in response to antigen presentation by CD103(+) dermal DCs. CD103(+) DCs, despite inducing similar TFH responses as LCs, were less efficient in induction of germinal center B cells and humoral immune responses. We also found that skin DCs are sufficient to expand CXCR5(+) TFH cells through an IL-6- and IFN-α/β receptor-independent mechanism, but B cells were required for sustained Bcl-6(+) expression.']",These data demonstrate that a major unappreciated function of skin DCs is their promotion of TFH cells and humoral immune responses that potentially represent an efficient approach for vaccination.,easy,Skin dendritic cells have been shown to predominantly activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes rather than follicular helper T cells.,Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution

Does preventive methylene blue treatment preserve cognition in mice expressing full-length pro-aggregant human Tau?,"['Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of Tau are hallmarks of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. Transgenic mice expressing full-length pro-aggregant human Tau (2N4R Tau-ΔK280, termed Tau(ΔK)) or its repeat domain (TauRD-ΔK280, TauRD(ΔK)) develop a progressive Tau pathology with missorting, phosphorylation, aggregation of Tau, loss of synapses and functional deficits. Whereas TauRD(ΔK) assembles into NFT concomitant with neuronal death, Tau(ΔK) accumulates into Tau pretangles without overt neuronal loss. Both forms cause a comparable cognitive decline (with onset at 10mo and 12mo, respectively), which is rescued upon switch-off of transgene expression. Since methylene blue (MB) is able to inhibit Tau aggregation in vitro, we investigated whether MB can prevent or rescue Tau-induced cognitive impairments in our mouse models. Both types of mice received MB orally using different preventive and therapeutic treatment protocols, initiated either before or after disease onset. The cognitive status of the mice was assessed by behavior tasks (open field, Morris water maze) to determine the most successful conditions for therapeutic intervention.'
 'Preventive and therapeutic MB application failed to avert or recover learning and memory deficits of TauRD(ΔK) mice. Similarly, therapeutic MB treatment initiated after onset of cognitive impairments was ineffective in Tau(ΔK) mice. In contrast, preventive MB application starting before onset of functional deficits preserved cognition of Tau(ΔK) mice. Beside improved learning and memory, MB-treated Tau(ΔK) mice showed a strong decrease of insoluble Tau, a reduction of conformationally changed (MC1) and phosphorylated Tau species (AT180, PHF1) as well as an upregulation of protein degradation systems (autophagy and proteasome). This argues for additional pleiotropic effects of MB beyond its properties as Tau aggregation inhibitor.']",Our data support the use of Tau aggregation inhibitors as potential drugs for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies and highlights the need for preventive treatment before onset of cognitive impairments.,hard,"Methylene blue successfully preserves cognition in mice expressing full-length pro-aggregant human Tau when administered therapeutically, even after the onset of cognitive impairments.",Misinterpretation of #Question#
